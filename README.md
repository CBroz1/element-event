# canonical-behavior
Draft of DataJoints element for subject behavior for U24

## Process:
I looked at the structure for `element-array-ephys` for general principle on how to call and load files. I mirrored the main datajoint implementation as split from 'readers'. I incorporated feedback from project-specific `behavior.py` elsewhere in table development.

## To do:
- flush out table structure
- decide supported filetypes
- get in touch with [BPod folks](https://github.com/sanworks/) to see if there's already a more comprehensive implementation
- generate diagram
